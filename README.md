# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to detect **fake vs. real news articles** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
The model is trained on the [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) from Kaggle.  

Fake news has become one of the biggest challenges in the digital era. With the help of text preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, this project attempts to automatically classify whether a news article is **real** or **fake**.
